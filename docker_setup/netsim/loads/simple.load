#
# start_time: start time (in seconds) after this script starts to be executed.
#
# port: port number to access of this load event.
#
# bitrate: the bitrate of the chunks fetched in this load event.
# 
# interval: the time interval (in seconds) after the last fetched chunk in each
#           threads of this load event.
#
# chunk_num: the number of chunks need to be fetched in each threads of this load

# 
# threads: the number of concurrent threads in this load event.
